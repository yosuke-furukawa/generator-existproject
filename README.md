# generator-existproject

> Yeoman generator for Exisiting project (WIP)

I would like to create scaffolds, but the project seed has been created. So I just don't wanna copy these project files to generator/app/templates manually.

## Getting started

- Install: `npm install -g generator-existproject`
- Run: `yo existproject`
